          <h1>Who are the Ewoks?</h1>
            <p>
              The Ewoks are native to the moon of Endor. They are curious animals that are around one meter tall.<br> Their skills include forest survival and the building of primitive technology like gliders and catapults. <br>They are quick learners when it comes to new and advanced technology. <br>The Ewoks accepted members of the Rebel Alliance into their tribe, and allied themselves to their cause. <br>The Ewoks helped to destroy the Imperial shield generator built in their forests, and their primitive weapons <br>helped to eliminate the stormtroopers and the scout walkers of the Empire. <br> Their help allowed the essential victory at the Battle of Endor.
