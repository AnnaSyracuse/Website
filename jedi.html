          <h1>Who are the Jedi?</h1>
          <p>The Jedi are selected members of society who know how to access and use the force. <br>Together, or alone, they fight against the evil within the galaxy. Their prime weapon is the lightsaber, <br>but many use the force as a tool as well.</p>
          <h4>Rey:</h4>
          <p>Her parents seemingly abandoned her on Jakku at a young age. <br>She grew up as a scavenger, scrounging up whatever food she could manage. <br>When she agreed to help a droid on an urgent mission from the resistance, her life changed forever. <br>Rey discovered the force was strong with her, and she sought out training from the vanished <b>Luke Skywalker</b>. <br>Through resiliance and grit, Rey continued to train. Her connection to Kylo Ren soon became known. <br> She then faced her greatest test: a confrontation with fear and evil that would soon determine the galaxy's fate.</p>
          <h4>Luke Skywalker:</h4>
          <p>Luke Skywalker started off as a Tatooine farmboy. <br>With his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke batteled the evil Empire. <br>On his journy he discovered the truth about his lineage, ended the tyranny of the Sith, and soon became <br>the greatest Jedi the galaxy had ever seen. A generation later, he went into hiding, <br>the location of the former Jedi master was undisclosed. <br>He was haunted by Ben Solo's failed teachings and fall to evil. However, his <br>solitude was soon interrupted. <br>Luke Skywalker now had one final, momentous role in the fight between good and evil.</p>
          <h4>Yoda:</h4>
          <p>Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master and his connection to the force was never before seen. <br>Although he was small in stature, he was extremely wise and powerful. <br>He trained Jedi for over 800 years, and played integral roles in the Clone Wars, <br>the training of Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immorality.</p>
